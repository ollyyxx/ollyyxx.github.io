<h1>Heyy Richard</h1>
<p>How are you today? I enjoyed our talk yesterday, thanks for listeneing. It was nice speaking to someone about all the ugly thoughts in my head. I'm going to try to be better and more positive. I just dont know how yet but hopefully pastoral care would help me figure it out. I'm going to try to not be a burden to you and i'll try harder to make you smile, because i feel like i kill your mood and make you gloomy. Anyway enjoy your day, i love you</p>
